# Hackathon_Spring2016
This repository is for Hackathon competition project which is of building Algorithm to solve the expression. Below is the definition.

                           ERICSSON USE CASE 1

Given a string representing an expression which consists of non-negative round numbers and four basic arithmetic operations, 
write a function which calculates final value of the expression. 
Although only non-negative numbers are allowed, end result or intermediate results may be negative. 
Four operations are: +, -, * and / . Expression may contain parentheses. 
Assume that expression is syntactically correct: all operators have proper left and right operand, parentheses are properly nested 
and balanced.

Examples:
(3+2) <= 5 produces result true.
4/3 > 1 produces result true.
2*(3+6/2)/4 == 3 produces true.
(A1/A1_avg)*100 > 90 produces true given A1= 95 and A1_avg = 90.
(A1/A1_avg)*100 <= 90 && (A1/A1_avg)*100 > 80 produces true given A1= 85 and A1_avg = 90

Your code should accept list to input variables and the list of expressions and return the list of outputs.

Write a code to test 10000+ expressions and 100+ variables.
